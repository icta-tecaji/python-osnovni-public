Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
